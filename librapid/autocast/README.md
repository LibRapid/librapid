# AutoCast

The LibRapid AutoCast system allows datatypes to be specified at runtime and templated functions to be called with these runtime datatypes, as well as memory allocation, freeing and copying.

The system will also support CUDA and the ability to run lambda functions on the GPU or CPU, regardless of datatype and original memory location.

*Please note: it's entirely possible that none of this will work...*
