This directory contains 'mbench', a program written by Patrick PÃ©lissier
(INRIA) to bench MPFR for low precisions.

It is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License,
or (at your option) any later version.

To use the mbench program:
   Build it:
      make GMP=/dir/to/gmp MPFR=/dir/to/mpfr
   Run it by specifying the functions you want to bench:
      ./mfv5 mpfr_add mpfr_mul mpfr_sub mpfr_div mpfr_sqrt
   To have the lists of the available functions:
      ./mfv5 -l
   Help usage:
      ./mfv5 -h
   To build MFV5 with PARI/NTL/CLN/MAPM/ARPREC/CRLIBM support, build it with:
     make GMP=/dir/to/gmp MPFR=/dir/to/mpfr PARI=/dir/to/pari ...
   (It autodetects which library is available. Thus a non-existent directory
   can be given to disable a library installed on the system if it yields a
   build failure.)
   Then use ./mfv5 -l to have the lists of the available functions.
   To add a new function in MPFR (mpfr_toto), edit mfv5-mpfr.cc and add:

class mpfr_toto_test {
public:
  int func (mpfr_ptr a, mpfr_srcptr b, mpfr_srcptr c, mp_rnd_t r) {
    return mpfr_toto (a,b,r);
  }
};
static mpfr_test<mpfr_toto_test> testtoto ("mpfr_toto");

  Rebuild it and that's all.
