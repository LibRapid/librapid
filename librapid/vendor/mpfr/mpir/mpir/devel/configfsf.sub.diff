We can use the standard fsf config.sub , but we need change this (~line 1200)


	pmac | pmac-mpw)
		basic_machine=powerpc-apple
		;;
	*-unknown)
		# Make sure to match an already-canonicalized machine name.
		;;
	*)
		echo Invalid configuration \`$1\': machine \`$basic_machine\' not recognized 1>&2
		exit 1


	pmac | pmac-mpw)
		basic_machine=powerpc-apple
		;;
	*-unknown | *-pc | *-apple | *-w64)
		# Make sure to match an already-canonicalized machine name.
		;;
	*)
		echo Invalid configuration \`$1\': machine \`$basic_machine\' not recognized 1>&2
		exit 1


so that we recognize more default already-canonicalized machine names , because
we have so many more cpu names
