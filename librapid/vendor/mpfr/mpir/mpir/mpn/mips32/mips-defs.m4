dnl  Usage: ASM_START()
define(`ASM_START',
m4_assert_numargs(0)
`	.set noreorder
	.set noat
	.set nomacro')

dnl  Usage: X(value)
define(`X',
m4_assert_numargs(1)
`0x$1')

dnl  Called: PROLOGUE_cpu(GSYM_PREFIX`'foo)
dnl          EPILOGUE_cpu(GSYM_PREFIX`'foo)

define(`PROLOGUE_cpu',
m4_assert_numargs(1)
`	.text
	.align	4
	.globl	$1
	.ent	$1
$1:')

define(`EPILOGUE_cpu',
m4_assert_numargs(1)
`	.end	$1')


dnl  Usage: r0 ... r31
dnl         f0 ... f31
dnl
dnl  Map register names r0 to $0, and f0 to $f0, etc.
dnl
dnl  defreg() is used to protect the $ in $0 (otherwise it would represent a
dnl  macro argument).  Double quoting is used to protect the f0 in $f0
dnl  (otherwise it would be an infinite recursion).

forloop(i,0,31,`defreg(`r'i,$i)')
forloop(i,0,31,`deflit(`f'i,``$f''i)')


dnl  Usage: ASM_END()
define(`ASM_END',
m4_assert_numargs(0)
