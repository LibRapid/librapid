   being how many udiv divisions will be done.

   The default is to use preinv always, CPUs where this doesn't suit have

/* The comments in mpn/generic/divrem_1.c apply here too.

   As noted in the algorithms section of the manual, the shifts in the loop
   for the unnorm case can be avoided by calculating r = a%(d*2^n), followed
   by a final (r*2^n)%(d*2^n).  In fact if it happens that a%(d*2^n) can
   skip a division where (a*2^n)%(d*2^n) can't then there's the same number
   of divide steps, though how often that happens depends on the assumed
   distributions of dividend and divisor.  In any case this idea is left to
   CPU specific implementations to consider.  */
