.gdbinit - three basic macros for printing mpz, mpq and mpf's in gdb
acinclude - many GMP specific script macros to be used by autoconf
aclocal - scripts for setting up the tools used to build MPIR on a wide variety of platforms - part of autotools
ansi2knr - a script belonging to ansi2knr
ansi2knr.c - C program for converting from Ansi C to Kernighan and Ritchie C
assert.c - two MPIR wide assert functions

compat.c - some function entry points for three deprecated functions
config.in - piles of undefs for all environment variables used by MPIR
config.guess - MPIR script to try and guess what the CPU-VENDOR-OS is 
config.sub - gives CPU-VENDOR-OS names MPIR recognizes, in some canonical way
configfsf - the GNU CPU-VENDOR-OS guess program, later sharpened by config.guess
configfsf.sub - common to all GNU software, attempts to come up with canonical CPU-VENDOR-OS
configure - guess values for system dependent variables and create Makefiles
