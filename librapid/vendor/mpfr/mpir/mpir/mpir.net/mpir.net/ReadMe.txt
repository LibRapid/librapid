========================================================================
This project is a .Net wrapper for the MPIR library.
It is a new implementation of the MPIR interface, 
inspired by the MPIR C++ interface but using C++/CLI,
for consumption by managed .Net languages.
It is a Visual Studio build only, targeting .Net on Windows x86 or x64.
It can be linked with a Win32 or x64 MPIR static (Lib) build for any 
MPIR-supported processor architecture.
