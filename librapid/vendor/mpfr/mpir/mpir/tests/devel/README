                       DEVELOPMENT TEST PROGRAMS


This directory contains various programs used during development.  Casual
GMP users are unlikely to find anything of interest.

Nothing here is built or installed, nor even run in a "make check", but
there's Makefile rules to build each program, or "allprogs" to build
everything.
