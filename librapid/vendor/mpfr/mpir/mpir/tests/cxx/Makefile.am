# Libtool (1.5) somehow botches its uninstalled shared library setups on
# OpenBSD 3.2, making the C++ test programs here fail.  libgmpxx.so ends up
# with a NEEDED record asking for ./.libs/libgmp.so.N, but the loader can't
# find that unless it exists in the current directory.
#
# FIXME: Clearly libtool ought to handle this itself, in which case the hack
# here can be removed.

# Note this fix applies only when running "make check".  The cp here should
# be done manually if just one program is to be built and run.
