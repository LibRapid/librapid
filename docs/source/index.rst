In essence, LibRapid seeks to make it possible to perform multidimensional arrays, machine learning, and arbitrary-precision arithmetic operations more quickly. 
Basic colour manipulation and access to terminal attributes are just a couple of the utility features that LibRapid includes to cut down on dependencies. 
The entire library is extensively optimised and, when appropriate, supports GPU calculations.

Perfomance
----------
Because of LibRapid's highly optimised functions and routines, your code will run faster. Almost all functions perform better than NumPy and comparable libraries.
Additionally, functions are continually improved. Developers of LibRapid will endeavour to optimise it till they are satisfied with the performance if it is slower than NumPy in any way.
Although both the C++ and Python libraries will function perfectly without a CBLAS compatible library, using built-in, but slower, routines, they are both intended to work with any CBLAS compliant library, such as ATLAS or OpenBLAS.
