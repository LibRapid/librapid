## **Credits**
---
Thanks to @NervousNullPtr for his help on the library. He and I collaborate to provide the best user experience possible, as
well as to produce innovative new ideas and faster, more efficient code.

## **Why Use Librapid?**
---
In short, LibRapid aims to allow for faster mathematical calculations, including multidimensional arrays, machine learning and arbitrary-precision arithmetic. LibRapid also includes some helper functions to reduce dependencies, such as basic colour manipulation and access to console properties. The entire library is highly optimised and supports GPU calculations where applicable.

## **How it Works**
---
LibRapid is a highly-optimised C++ (and CUDA) library, which can be found at `./src/librapid`. The C++ library is
interfaced with Python using [PyBind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11), meaning very little performance is lost
between the C++ backend and Python frontend of the library. LibRapid also makes use of some
of [Agner Fog's](https://agner.org) libraries and optimisations to accelerate low-level functions and increase
performance.

LibRapid also aims to provide a consistent interface between the C++ and Python libraries, allowing you to use the
library comprehensively in both languages without having to trawl through two sets of documentation.

Please note that the Python interface has been adjusted slightly from the C++ interface to provide a more "pythonic"
feel without reducing the overall functionality.

## **Installing LibRapid**
---
### **Python**

To install LibRapid as a Python library, simply run `pip install librapid` in the command line. Hopefully, there will be precompiled wheels available for your operating system and python version, meaning you will not need a C++ compiler to install it (if this is not the case, a modern C++ compiler will be required).

#### *Note*

When using a source-build of LibRapid with CUDA under PyPy, the garbage collection system can lead to some problems with running out of memory. We're not sure how to get around this as we believe it is just a quirk of PyPy to improve performance, but it can lead to substantial problems if you're not careful.

#### Building from Source

To enable CUDA support, to use your own BLAS library or to get a (potentially) more optimised install of the library,
you will have to build LibRapid from source:

``` powershell
git clone https://github.com/LibRapid/librapid.git --recursive
cd librapid
pip install . -vvv
```

### **C++**

To use the library in C++, you have a few options. The first option is to download the `.zip` file for librapid, copy +
paste all of the source and header files and add them all to your project.

You can also use librapid in your `CMake` projects by either using the `FetchContent` feature, or by adding the librapid
subdirectory.

Using `FetchContent`:

```cmake
# CMake

add_executable(MyApp myapp.cpp)

include(FetchContent)
FetchContent_Declare(librapid GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/librapid/librapid.git)
FetchContent_MakeAvailable(librapid)

target_link_libraries(MyApp librapid)
```

Or using `add_subdirectory`:

```powershell
# Command line

git clone https://github.com/librapid/librapid.git --recursive
```

```cmake
# CMake

add_executable(MyApp myapp.cpp)

add_subdirectory(librapid)

target_link_libraries(MyApp librapid)
```

## **Documentation**
---
### Viewing Online

Documentation can be found online [here](https://librapid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on ReadTheDocs.

### Building from Source

If you would like to build it yourself, you will need to install the required software:
``` powershell
# Command line

pip install -r docs/requirements
```

You will also need to install a recent version of Doxygen, which you can
find [here](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html)

To build the documentation, open a command line window in the `docs` directory and run `make html`. You can then
open the file `docs/build/html/index.html` in a web-browser to view the documentation.

## **Performance**
---
LibRapid has highly optimised functions and routines, meaning your code will be faster as a result. Nearly all functions
exceed the performance of [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) and equivalent libraries. Functions are also being
optimised further all the time. Anything slower than `NumPy` is considered a bug, and LibRapid developers will attempt to
optimise it until they are satisfied with the performance.

Both the C++ and Python libraries are designed to work with any CBLAS compatible library, such
as [ATLAS](https://github.com/math-atlas/math-atlas) or [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS), though will be
fully functional without one, using built-in, but slower, routines.

### Parallel Code

LibRapid is designed to use multiple threads to run code faster. The number of threads used for these operations will
default to the number of threads available on the system, however this may end up leading to slower code when the number
of threads exceeds 12-16. To set the number of threads, use the following functions:

``` cpp
// C++

librapid::setNumThreads(<num>); // Set threads to <num>. <num> must be a positive integer.
librapid::getNumThreads();      // Get the number of threads. If OpenMP was not found, it returns 1.
```

``` python
# Python

librapid.setNumThreads(<num>); # Set threads to <num>. <num> must be a positive integer.
librapid.getNumThreads();      # Get the number of threads. If OpenMP was not found, it returns 1.
```

The `CMakeLists.txt` file will attempt to find a BLAS installation automatically, though it may fail if the files are
not strucutred correctly (see below).

If you build LibRapid from source, it will automatically search some specific directories for a BLAS install, though if
one is not found, BLAS will not be linked and internal routines will be used instead. Please note that the BLAS install
must have the following file structure:

``` None
blas-dir
├── include
|   └── cblas.h
├── lib
|   └── your-blas-lib.lib
└── bin (Only on Windows)
    └── your-blas-dll.dll
```

### Recommended Setup for Optimal Performance

The recommended BLAS library to use is `OpenBLAS`, though it is very slow and tedious to build (especially on Windows).
For this reason, pre-built binaries are provided which are optimised for most processors and architectures. To download
these, go to https://github.com/LibRapid/librapid/actions and select the most recent build (don't worry if it failed!).
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and download the `.zip` file for your operating system:

``` None
OpenBLAS on macos-latest    :  MacOS
OpenBLAS on ubuntu-latest   :  All GNU+Linux Distributions
OpenBLAS on windows-latest  :  Windows
```

Unzip this and put the contents in
- `C:/opt/OpenBLAS` on Windows, or
- `/opt/OpenBLAS` on Unix-like Operating Systems.

The directory structure should
look similar to this (example on Windows):

``` None
<root directory> # C:/, /, etc.
└── opt
    ├── bin
    │   └── openblas.dll
    ├── include
    │   └── openblas
    │       ├── cblas.h
    │       ├── f77blas.h
    │       ├── lapack.h
    │       ├── lapacke.h
    │       ├── lapacke_config.h
    │       ├── lapacke_example_aux.h
    │       ├── lapacke_mangling.h
    │       ├── lapacke_utils.h
    │       ├── openblas
    │       │   └── lapacke_mangling.h
    │       └── openblas_config.h
    ├── lib
    │   ├── openblas.lib
    │   └── pkgconfig
    │       └── openblas.pc
    └── share
        └── cmake
            └── OpenBLAS
                ├── OpenBLASConfig.cmake
                ├── OpenBLASConfigVersion.cmake
                ├── OpenBLASTargets-release.cmake
                └── OpenBLASTargets.cmake
```

With OpenBLAS set up in this way, LibRapid will automatically find and use it, whether you're in C++ or building from
source for Python. This will (most likely) also give the best performance for the library.
